        <p>
            A macaron is a meringue-based sandwich cookie made with almond flour, egg whites, confectioners' sugar, and food coloring. Common fillings 
            include buttercream, ganache, and fruit-based jam. The meringues 
            have smooth tops, ruffled edges (called the "crown," "foot," or "pied"), and flat bottoms. Popular myth say 
             two nuns from the city of Nancy purportedly sold macarons commercially during the 
             French Revolutionary in 1792 and made it famous.

        <img src="second.jpeg" alt="Profiteroles" height = "160">
        <p>Legend has it that has it that the chefs of Catherine de Medici from Italy introduced Profiteroles when she married Henry
             II of France.this filled French choux pastry ball contains whipped cream, custard or ice-cream, and is decorated with 
             powdered sugar, caramel or chocolate.</p></div>
    <div id = "third"><h2>Religieuse</h2>
        <img src="third.webp" alt="Religieuse" height = "160">
    <p>Created in the 19th century by Italian pastry chef Frascati in Paris, this is considered one of the most famous 
        desserts in France. Translates to mean ‘nun’, it consists of two choux buns on top of each other, resembling
         a chubby nun with a small habit around her shoulders. The bottom half of the religieuse is larger and fatter
          while the top circular is smaller, both filled with cream or custard. Some versions contain chestnut cream, coffee, caramel or rose flavours.</p>

    <div id = "fourth"><h2>Pain Au Chocolat</h2>
        <img src="fourth.jpeg" alt="Pain Au Chocolat" height = "160">
    <p>
        Originally made from a brioche base, Pain Au Chocolate means ‘chocolate bread’ in French and has since evolved to use the same buttery, 
        flaky pastry as a croissant. It made its first appearance in the early 19th century and is also known as chocolatine in the
         south-west part of France.

    <div id="fifth"><h2>Mille Feuille</h2>
        <img src="fifth.jpeg" alt="Mille Feuille" height = "160">
        <p>
            A traditional mille-feuille, translated to mean ‘a thousand leaves’, consists of three layers of puff pastry,
             alternating with two layers of pastry cream, and is dusted with powdered sugar on top. It sounds simple enough in 
             execution but takes a real expert to deliver an airy, flaky and crisp vanilla slice. Similar to the Italian Napoleon that
              is filled with almond cream, some mille feuille variations include whipped cream, fruits, custard or chocolate glaze. The first
               mille feuille recipe was seen in chef François Pierre de la Varenne’s cookbook Le Cuisinier François in 1651 and famous pastry chef
                Adolphe Seugnot has been credited with the creation as well in the 19th century.
